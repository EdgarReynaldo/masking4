<h1><a name="todo">A short list of things waiting to be done</a></h1>

<p>MASkinG has not yet reached version 1.0 and is still pretty much a work in
   progress. This means that quite a few planned features haven't been yet
   implemented, some have not been tested and still have bugs and new
   features are being added all the time. What follows is an incomplete list of
   things that are scheduled for implementation or are only halfway completed
   or simply don't work properly yet. If you have anything to add to this
   list or if you would even like to implement something yourself, your
   contribution will be greatly appreciated.

<br><br>
<p><b>TODO:</b><br><br>
<table width="96%" align="center"><tr><td>
<li>Implement subbitmaps with negative offsets. Because the canvas bitmaps
	for the widgets are implemented as subbitmaps of the screen bitmap,
	no widget can be placed to the left of the left edge of the screen or
	above the top edge. Subbitmaps with negative offsets can be made
	simply by deriving a class from Bitmap and overloading all the drawing
	primitives to calculate the actual coordinates from the offset and
	requested drawing coordinates.<br>
	Perhaps also clip the widget drawing canvas to the parent dialog so
	that the widget won't "stick" out when it isn't completely contained
	in the dialog.<br>
	Also the way widgets are positioned will have to be changed because right
	now, positioning a widget with negative	coordinates is used to align
	it relative to the right and bottom edge of the dialog.</li>
<br>
<li>Completely modularize the library. All platform specific functions and
	functions specific to Allegro should be completely separated from the
	core library and abstracted into easily interchangable modules. This will
	allow the library to become a wrapper for an arbitrary low level
	implementation of platform dependant functionalities (i.e. Allegro).
	Modules that need to be abstracted are: graphics system driver, all
	input drivers (keyboard, mouse, joystick), sound system driver, content
	data handlers (bitmaps, samples, music, fonts, 3D objects, etc.),
	datafile handlers (Allegro datafiles, zips, etc.), file I/O, config
	files, strings, data structures (vectors, lists, etc.) and perhaps
	some others.</li>
<br>
<li>Implement simple scripting capabilities. It should be possible to create
	a dialog by reading in its description from a simple script file
	similar to a resource script in Windows. In the script it should be
	possible to add any of the built in widgets, set their geometry,
	keyboard shortuct, flags and other widget specific properties such
	as text, range of values (for sliders for examples, ID of the
	message the widget should respond with and so on. For this last thing
	to work it will also be necessary to add the possibility to assign
	a message ID to any widget that can be activated (like buttons for
	example). The widget will then respond to being clicked (or whatever)
	with this message ID or with MSG_ACTIVATE as it is in the current
	release if no special ID is set. This will allow to easily map several
	widgets to the same message, for example one might have a menu entry,
	a toolbar icon and a keyboard shortcut all do the same thing.<br>
	Perhaps also functionality required to animate a dialog (e.g. to slide
	the buttons and panels in from one side StarCraft style when the dialog
	starts) could be added with scripts.<br><br>
	EDIT: callbackID overrides already implemented</li>
<br>
<li>Add new and more advanced widgets such as tree lists, lists with multiple
	columns, a text editor, a toolbar, a status bar, etc. (ideas are welcome).
	Also reimplement some widgets and dialogs, especially ListBox which
	should be built on top of the ScrollBox class and the file selector
	(which doesn't even work sometimes) so that it will easily be extensible.
	Also some other widgets	might need to be redesigned or just improved,
	for example sliders with tick marks, buttons with custom bitmap labels
	and so on...</li>
<br>
<li>Implement a clipboard. A clipboard should work with the most commonly
	used data types such as text and bitmaps and also with any
	user specified data. It should not directly use the clipboard provided
	by the platform the program is run on, but it should be able to
	transparently communicate with it if it is available
	(i.e. under Windows). Perhaps also build an undo/redo system on
	top of the clipboard.</li>
<br>
<li>Test and further improve OpenGL support. Perhaps add a direct driver
	that won't immediately support all the nice 2D features of the library
	but will run at optimal speed. Maybe also add to that some
	widgets that will use OpenGL accelerated graphics functions such as
	blending, etc.</li>
<br>
<li>Add a LayoutManager class hierarchy (GridLayout, FlowLayout, etc.) for
	automatically placing and resizing widgets in a dialog without having
	to deal with absolute coordinates manually.</li>
<br>
<li>Find and fix various little bugs. A list of some of the most obvious bugs
	that were found but have not yet been fixed:
	<table width="88%" align="center"><tr><td>
		<li>The TAB key doesn't always work properly.</li>
		<li>The DRS system has problems when modeless windows are present in
		    the dialog - it sometimes draws over them when it shouldn't.</li>
		<li>When selecting a menu item sometimes the first item of the menu
			also gets selected. Harmless but annoying.</li>
		<li>When the mouse hovers over the bottom part of the listbox, the
			list automatically scrolls down when in fact it shouldn't.</li>
		<li>Tooltips (and other widgets) sometimes get clipped to their parent
			dialog and sometimes they are drawn over even though they are
			supposed to be always on top.</li>
		<li>Spinboxes that are supposed to work with integers display the
			number in flotaing point format (e.g. 1.0 instead of 1).</li>
		<li>Listboxes sometimes wrongly calculate the size of the sidebar
			scroller (when the height of the individual items change and/or
			the height of all the items in the list is not the same).</li>
		<li>The file selector has serious issues - to many to list them all.
			It would probably be best to rewrite the selector from scratch.</li>
		<li>Keyboard navigation support in menus is a bit broken.</li>
		<li>Resizing a window to a very small size can produce unexpected
			results. The contentes of the window can sometimes fall out of
			the window when they should in fact be clipped.</li>
		<li>Popup (modal) windows in general don't work very well.</li>
		<li>All types of buttons use the same animation. Make each use
			a separate animation settings.</li>
		<li>True type fonts don't work in OpenGL mode.</li>
