<b><a name="guidebitmaps">Bitmaps</a></b><br>
   The bitmap datafile can be any Allegro datafile. It can contain any data you
   want although it is recommended that you use one data file for your skin and
   another one for other data (sprites, sounds, music, etc.) The datafile does
   not have to contain all the bitmaps required by the skin. If some are missing
   the default ones are generated. The only convention that you have to keep to
   when creating bitmap datafiles is that your bitmaps have these names:   
<pre>
      BOX                    - for a regular group box with title text
      BOX_SHADDOW            - for a box with a shadow (not commonly used)
      BUTTON                 - for buttons and winbuttons
      CHECKBOX               - for a checkbox button
      CLEAR_BACK             - for the background (can be a desktop wallpaper)
      COMBO_BUTTON           - the little arrow overlay for the combo box button
      HSLIDER_BACK           - background for a horizontal slider
      HSLIDER_GRIP           - the gripper for a horizontal slider
      ICONEXIT               - the exit icon (for a window)
      ICONMAX                - the maximize icon
      ICONMIN                - the minimize icon
      ICONRESTORE            - the restore icon (replaces ICONMAX in maxmized mode)
      LIST                   - for items of a list object
      MENU_BACK              - the background of menus

      SCROLL_DOWN            - the down arrows for scrollbars
      SCROLL_HBACK           - the background,
      SCROLL_HGRIP             gripper
      SCROLL_HGRIPOVERLAY      and gripper overlay for horizontal scrollers
      SCROLL_LEFT            - the left arrows for scrollbars
      SCROLL_RIGHT           - the right arrows for scrollbars
      SCROLL_UP              - the up arrows for scrollbars
      SCROLL_VBACK           - the background,
      SCROLL_VGRIP             gripper
      SCROLL_VGRIPOVERLAY      and gripper overlay for vertical scrollers
      SEPARATORH             - for the seprator
      SEPARATORV
      VSLIDER_BACK           - the background and
      VSLIDER_GRIP             gripper for vertical sliders
      WINBOTTOM              - the bottom,
      WINDOW                   the midle (the panel),
      WINGRIP                  the gripper bar,
      WINLEFT                  the left,
      WINRIGHT                 the right and
      WINTOP                   the top of a window
      WINTEXT                - the background of the window title
</pre>
<p>Most of these bitmaps contain several subbitmaps (usually 4) that are stacked
   vertically like this:
<pre>
      +------------+
      |   normal   |
      +------------+
      |  selected  |
      +------------+
      |  disabled  |
      +------------+
      |   focused  |
      +------------+
 </pre>
 <p>Each subbitmap corresponds to one of the states a dialog object can be in: normal,
    selected, disabled and focused (when it has the input focus).
 <p>There are however some exceptions:
 <pre>
       - All the boxes and panels, the wallpaper, the menu background and the
         window panel only have one subbitmap.
       - The checkbox and radio button bitmaps have two such stacks one next to
         another, one for unchecked state and one for checked state.
       - The menu button bitmap only has two subbitmap, for normal and selected menus.
       - The menu item has 7 subbitmaps: the first is normal item,
         then selected item and then the separator; after those are two bitmaps
         for normal and selected items that have a little arrow and then two more for
         normal and selected items with a checkmark.
       - The window frame bitmaps have two subbitmaps, one for when the window
         has input focus and the other for nonfocused state. The horizontal bitmaps
         (top, bottom and gripper) are stacked on top of each other and the vertical
         ones (left and right) are placed next to each other. The first bitmap is
         focused the second is normal.
       - The progress bar bitmaps have only 2 subbitmaps, one for the background and
         one for the bar; for vertical bars subbitmaps are placed next to each other
       - The separator bitmaps have no subbitmaps.
       - The vertical slider bitmaps have bitmaps placed next to each other.
</pre>
<p>Another thing you should keep in mind is the size of these bitmaps. Most of them
   are not tiled flat over the surface of a widget. Usually they are divided into
   3x3 equal smaller tiles which means that the width and height of the bitmap must be
   a multiple of 3 otherwise there will be inperfections due to round off error. What this
   means is that for example a button subbitmap has to be either 18x12 or 30x30 or
   something like that. A 17x11 bitmap for example will not look as you might expect.
   You can however override this behaviour by setting the TCKX and TCKY properties of
   the bitmaps (pres Ctrl+P in the Grabber tool to create a property). TCKX and TCKY
   are the horizontal and vertical thickness of the central area of the bitmap.
   For example if you have a panel bitmap that is 64x64 pixels large and the borders
   are all 3 pixels wide you will probably want to set TCKX and TCKY to 58 pixels.
   This will make sure that the 58x58 area in the centre of the bitmap is going to
   be tiled across the panel while the 3 pixels at the edges are going to be used
   for making a border. Alternatively you can set TCKX and TCKY in the ini file
   (see below). Settings in the ini file have a higher priority than datafile
   properties. Those will be used only no value is found in the ini file or if it
   is set to -1.<br>
   All four (or whatever) subbitmaps in a given bitmap must be equal in size. You cannot
   have a normal button of one size and a selected  button of another size.
<p>The best way to start making a skin is to simply rename an existing skin and
   replace the bitmaps with your own. If you still don't understand how they work
   just load a skin into the Grabber, export the bitmaps, edit them in your favourite
   bitmap editor and import them back into the grabber. It's that simple!
<p>You can use bitmaps of any color depth although 24 bit bitmaps are prefered. The
   areas of the bitmaps that are bright pink (255,0,255) are treated as
   transparent.

<p>   
<b><a name="guidepalette">Palette</a></b><br>
   Every skin should contain a palette that is used for 8 bit mode. This palette must
   be named <b>XTRA_PALETTE</b>. The skin bitmaps can be in any color depth but when you
   use a different bit depth for your program these bitmaps have to be converted. In order
   for the conversion to be good in 8 bit mode the palette must contain most (if not all)
   of the colors that are used by the bitmaps.

<p>   
<b><a name="guidecursors">Cursors</a></b><br>
   Again like with the bitmaps the cursors too are stored in an Allegro datafile. They
   can be in any datafile you want although it is recommended that you keep your
   cursors in a separate file. The names of your cursors must be:
<pre>
      MOUSE_ALTERNATIVE         - alternative select
      MOUSE_CROSSHAIR           - accurate select
      MOUSE_HOURGLASS           - an hourglass or equivalent
      MOUSE_MOVE                - for objects that can move
      MOUSE_NORMAL              - a normal arrow
      MOUSE_SELECT              - for selecting links and the like
      MOUSE_SIZE_DIAGONAL1      - for NW-SE resizing
      MOUSE_SIZE_DIAGONAL2      - for NE-SW resizing
      MOUSE_SIZE_HORIZONTAL     - for horizontal resizing
      MOUSE_SIZE_VERTICAL       - for vertical resizing
      MOUSE_TEXTSELECT          - for selecting text
      MOUSE_UNAVAILABLE         - for indicating that an object is unavailable
</pre>
<p>Note that some of the cursors are actually not used by any dialog object. They are
   here just for completeness (and for future compatibility) so you can safely
   ignore them.
<p>All the bitmaps can be of any size and color depth. The transparent areas should
   be bright pink.
<p>Every cusrsor sprite should also set a few extra properties (press Ctrl+P in the
   Grabber), namely FCSX, FCSY, FRMS and FDUR. FCSX and FCSY describe the focus point
   of the cursor. The focus point of a mouse cursor is the point that actually
   represents the position of the mouse. For a standard arrow this is (0, 0) but for
   most other pointers this is somewhere else. FRMS and FDUR are only relevant for
   animated cursors and are the number of frames and the duration of one frame in
   miliseconds. As is the case with the bitmaps, the cursor settings can also be
   overridden in the ini file (see below).

<p>   
<b><a name="guidefonts">Fonts</a></b><br>
   There isn't much to say about fonts. They are stored in disk files in their native
   formats (as opposed to being packed in a datafile). The formats supported by
   MASkinG are: monochrome and coloured bitmap fonts (must be either in BMP, PCX, LBM
   or TGA format), BIOS 8x8 and 16x16 fonts (files must have a FNT extension), GRX
   fonts (FNT extension), scripted fonts (TXT), true type fonts (TTF), type 1 fonts,
   open type fonts and a few others (see alfont documentation for details).
   
<p>   
<b><a name="guidesamples">Samples</a></b><br>
   The samples are just like the bitmaps and cursors stored in a datafile. Their names
   must be:
<pre>
      SAMPLE_ACTIVATE          - used with the MSG_ACTIVATE event
      SAMPLE_CLOSE             - played when something closes down (like a menu, combo box, etc.)
      SAMPLE_GOTFOCUS          - played when an object receives input focus
      SAMPLE_KEY               - currently used only by the edit text object when entering text
      SAMPLE_LOSTFOCUS         - played when an object looses focus
      SAMPLE_OPEN              - opposite of SAMPLE_CLOSE
      SAMPLE_SCROLL            - used with the MSG_SCROLL event
</pre>
   The samples can be in any format recognized by Allegro and the Grabber utility.

<p>   
<b><a name="guideconfig">The config file</a></b><br>
   The skin configuration file is a regular Allegro configuration file which in
   turn is a regular text file. The format is the same as with most other .cfg and
   .ini files you may have come across. There are many sections that start with
   a section title followed by variable definitions like this:
<pre>
      [SECTION]
      variable1 = 45
      variable2 = some_text
      variable3 = true
      ...
</pre>
<p>The MASkinG skin configuration file has the following sections:
<pre>
      [SKIN]       - general skin information (title, author, datafiles, etc.)
      [MOUSE]      - mouse cursor settings
      [BOX]        - font, font color and other definitions for
      [BUTTON]       the dialog objects that require additional
      [HYPER]        information (see bellow)
      [CHECKBOX]
      [RADIO]
      [LIST]
      [COMBOBOX]
      [TEXT]
      [WALLPAPER]
      [MENU]
      [WINDOW]
      [TOOLTIP]
      [FONT0]       - the definition of fonts
      [FONT1]
        ...
      [FONT7]
      [COLORS]      - the default colors
</pre>
<p>The [SKIN] section has the following definitions:
<pre>
      main_data = path_to_bitmaps.dat
      cursors = path_to_pointers.dat
      sounds = path_to_sounds.dat
      dottedRect = { 0 | 1 }         - set to 1 if the objects should have a dotted
                                       rectangle around them when they have focus
      focus = { 0 | 1 | 2}           - if 0 focus will follow the mouse, if 1 widgets
                                       may grab focus else a click is required to move focus
</pre>
<p>The dialog objects sections have the following definitions:
<pre>
      font1 = n         - the indices into the array of fonts for each state the
      font2 = n           object can be in: normal, selected, disabled, focused;
      font3 = n           the indices are zero based (they go from 0 to 7)
      font4 = n
      f_col1 = r,g,b    - the primary font colors for the 4 states in "r,g,b"
      f_col2 = r,g,b      format; the r, g and b must be integers ranging from
      f_col3 = r,g,b      0 to 255 and they can be separated with commas, semicolons
      f_col4 = r,g,b      or spaces, e.g: 128,100,212 or 64 134 98 (use -1 for color fonts)
      s_col1 = r,g,b    - the secondary font colors (the shadow color); this is
      s_col2 = r,g,b      also a regular r,g,b construct but can also be -1; in this
      s_col3 = r,g,b      case the shadow color is undefined and unused
      s_col4 = r,g,b
</pre>
<p>Some dialog objects also have other variable definitions specific for them:
<pre>
      [WALLPAPER]
      style = { 0-4 }   - defines how the wallpaper bitmap is blitted to
                          the screen (0 - centered, 1 - in the top-left corner,
                          2 - stretched, 3 - tiled, 4 - tiled with TiledBlit())


      [BOX]
      offX = n                   - position of the title text (x coordinate)
      offY = n                                   -"-          (y coordinate)
      backColor = r,g,b          - the color to be used for title background
      alignment = { 0 | 1 | 2 }  - how the title text should be aligned (0 - left,
                                   1 - right, 2 - centre)

      [COMBOBOX]
      animationType = n          - animation style (see animator.h for a list of styles)
      animationLength = n        - animation length in miliseconds

      [BUTTON]
      animationType = n
      animationLength = n
      displacement = n           - text displacement of a selected button in pixels
      
      [MENU]
      height = n                 - default height of a menu item
      delay = n                  - the menu auto open delay in miliseconds
      animationType = n
      animationLength = n

      [WINDOW]
      textX = n                 - the first three variables are exactly the same as
      textY = n                   for the box dialog object (see above)
      alignment = { 0 | 1 | 2 }
      exitX = n                 - these are the positions of the 3 window icons: exit
      exitY = n                   maximize and minimize; the coordinates can also
      maxX = n                    be negative which means that the icons will be placed
      maxY = n                    relative to the right or bottom edge; coordinates
      minX = n                    (-30, 5) for example will position the icon 30
      minY = n                    pixels from the right and 5 pixels from the top
      animationType = n         - type and length of popup animations
      animationLength = n

	  [TOOLTIP]
      backColor = r,g,b         - the background colour of the popup help bubbles
	  border color = r,g,b      - the border colour of the popup help bubbles
      animationType = n
      animationLength = n
</pre>
<p>There are 8 font definitions in a skin file and are defined like this:
<pre>
      [FONTn]                    - n is a number between 0 and 7
      size = n                   - the size of the true type font
      file = 'path_to_font'
      
      Note: the path to the font can be absolute (e.g. "e:\my_fonts\arial.ttf") or
             relative (e.g. "..\..\data\font\arial.ttf"). If the font can't be located
             then MASkinG will look into a subdirectory called "fonts" of the directory
             specified in the evironment variable called "WINDIR" which is usually
             "c:\windows". This allows you to write something like "font=tahoma.ttf" and
             MASkinG will load "tahoma.ttf" from you "windows\fonts\" directory.
</pre>
<p>The default colors are defined as r,g,b triplets:
<pre>
      [COLORS]
      face = r,g,b         - the face color of the objects (usually a shade of gray)
      fontface = r,g,b     - the normal font color
      shad1 = r,g,b        - the 2 shadow colors for pseudo 3D effects
      shad2 = r,g,b
      disable = r,g,b      - the font color for disabled objects
      select = r,g,b       - the face color for selected objects
      deselect = r,g,b     - the normal face color of some objects (buttons)
      focus = r,g,b        - the font color of the objects
      back = r,g,b         - the default background color
      sunken = r,g,b       - the color of the sunken panels interior (used by SList)
</pre>
<p>The skin bitmap tiling info can be stored inside the datafile in the form of
   datafile properties but it is much more convenient to define them in the ini
   file. This is defined in the TILING section for each bitmap individually.
   The name of each variable is the name of the bitmap (see above) suffixed with
   _TCKX for horizontal tiling ino and _TCKY for vertical tiling info.
<pre>
      Example:
     
      [TILING]
      BOX_TCKX = 32
      BOX_TCKY = 25
       
      BOX_SHADOW_TCKX = 18
      BOX_SHADOW_TCKY = 42
      
      BUTTON_TCKX = 12
      BUTTON_TCKY = -1
	  
	  ...and so on...
</pre>
   Note that these settings will override the same settings defined with datafile properties.
<p>As for bitmaps, settings can be defined for the cursors too. For cursors there
   are four values: FCSX, FCSY, FRMS and FDUR (see abobe for their meaning). They
   will override their equivalent datafile properties as long as they are not -1.
<p>You don't actually have to specify each and every variables value. If you leave
   some out the defaults will be used. See the data section of this documentation to
   see what the default are for each variable.
<p>You can also add some of your own text into the skin configuration file. Especially
   the [SKIN] section has a few definitions that aren't actually used but it's nice
   if they are there. Check out some of the premade skins to see how it's all done.
   There is also a template.ini file in the skin directory where all the variables
   are documented.
