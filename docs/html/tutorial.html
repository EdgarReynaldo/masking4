<h1><a name="tutorial">A short MASkinG Tutorial</a></h1>

<p>This short tutorial will introduce you to writing a graphical user interface
   or GUI (pronounced "gooey") with the MASkinG programming library. It doesn't
   require any prior knowledge of the Allegro GUI although if you haven't used
   it before it is recommended that you have the Allegro documentation at hand.

<b><a name="step1">Step 1 - Setting up Allegro and MASkinG</a></b><br>
   If you haven't installed MASkinG yet do it now. Compile the example programs to see if it works.<br>
   To start the tutorial you will first have to create a normal Allegro application. Just create a new
   file called 'tutorial.cpp' (or whatever you want) and type in the following lines:
<pre>
   #include &lt;MASkinG.h&gt;
   using namespace MAS;
</pre>
   The first line includes the MASkinG header (note: you don't need to explicitly include allegro.h because it
   gets included with MASkinG.h) and the second one makes sure all classes from the MAS namespace can be accessed
   directly. You can of course skip the second line but then you will have to prefix every MASkinG class and
   function name with "MAS::" in order to be able to access it.

<p>Then write the main() function and initialize MASkinG:
<pre>
   int main() {
      Error e = InstallMASkinG("allegro.cfg");
      if (e) {
         e.Report();
      }

      return 0;
   }
   END_OF_MAIN();
</pre>
   The InstallMASkinG() function will read the settings from the 'allegro.cfg' file,
   install and initialize all required modules, set the graphics mode and initialize
   MASkinG itself. If you want the settings to be read from a different file, just pass
   its name as a parameter to the InstallMASkinG() function. If the file you're trying
   to read settings from doesn't exist, MASkinG will create a new one and fill it in
   with the default settings. If you don't want to read settings from a config file just
   don't pass anything to InstallMASkinG(). In that case you can change the members
   of the <a href="settings.html">Settings</a> class as you wish before calling
   InstallMASkinG().
<p>As you can see InstallMAskinG() is a very handy function but as it does everything
   automatically your program has no control over what settings to use. If you need
   more control you can alternatively install MASkinG "manually":
<pre>
   allegro_init();
   install_keyboard();
   install_timer();
   install_mouse();
   set_color_depth(16);
   set_gfx_mode(GFX_AUTODETECT, 640, 480, 0, 0);
   alfont_init();

   Timer::Lock();
   Color::OnColorDepthChange();
   theSkin = new Skin("myskin.ini");
</pre>
<p>This is exactly what the InstallMASkinG() function does except that it reads settings
   from a configuration file, sets up a couple of other things and of course does
   error checking which is what you should do too.
<p>Just before your program exits you have to make sure all the resources used by the skin are freed. You
   do this by calling the ExitMASkinG() function.
<p>In the end your main source file should look like this:
<pre>
   //--------------------file: tutorial.cpp----------------------------

   #include &lt;MASkinG.h&gt;
   using namespace MAS;

   int main() {
      Error e = InstallMASkinG("allegro.cfg");
      if (e) {
         e.Report();
     }

      ExitMASkinG();

      allegro_message("Finished successfully!");
      return 0;
   }
   END_OF_MAIN();

   //---------------------------eof------------------------------------
</pre>
   If you compile this you should get no errors. If you do, then read the "Installation" and "Using" sections of
   this documentation again. When you run the program the screen should go black for a moment and then
   the program should exit with a message saying it finished successfully.
</p>

<p>
<b><a name="step2">Step 2 - Making a simple dialog</a></b><br>
   In step 2 we will make our first simple dialog.
<p>In MASkinG every dialog should be derived from a class named Dialog. So create a new file called
   "MainDlg.h" and type the following into it:
<pre>
   //----------------------file: MainDlg.h-----------------------------

   #include &lt;MASkinG.h&gt;
   using namespace MAS;

   #ifndef MAINDLG_H
   #define MAINDLG_H

   class MainDlg : public Dialog {
      private:
         ClearScreen desktop;
         Panel pBox;
         Button bQuit;

      public:
         MainDlg();
         virtual ~MainDlg();
   };

   #endif //MAINDLG_H

   //---------------------------eof------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Then make a new file called "MainDlg.cpp" and type the following into it:
<pre>
   //---------------------file: MainDlg.cpp----------------------------

   #include "MainDlg.h"

   MainDlg::MainDlg() : Dialog() {
      pBox.Shape(10, 10, 620, 460);
      bQuit.Setup(20, 440, 150, 20, KEY_Q, D_EXIT, "&Quit");

      Add(desktop);
      Add(pBox);
      Add(bQuit);
   }

   MainDlg::~MainDlg() {
   }

   //---------------------------eof------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>Finally change the main source file to include "MainDlg.h", delete the line that displays the message that says
   everything went OK and add the following between the calls to InstallMASkinG() and ExitMASkinG():
<pre>
   MainDlg *dlg = new MainDlg;
   dlg->Execute();
   delete dlg;
</pre>
<p>Now lets go through the code. The first file is a header file where our dialog is declared. It says that
   our dialog is called MainDlg and that it is derived from Dialog. The dialog contains three dialog objects
   (also called widgets). They are all private as we don't need them to be visible to the outside. The first is
   a ClearScreen with a very descriptive name - desktop. It is exactly what its name says. Every static dialog
   should have one (or a Wallpaper which uses a bitmap to paint the desktop instead of just a single colour).
   Next is a Panel. Panels don't actually do anything usefull. They are there just to visually
   separate objects and to make the dialog look a bit better. Finally there is a Button. This is just a normal
   button that we'll use to close the program with.<br>
   In the public section are two functions. They are the constructor and destructor. We will use the constructor
   to setup our dialog.

<p>The second file contains the implementation of our dialog. All the functionality that you expect from a dialog
   has already been coded into the base class - Dialog. In our dialog we just have to setup our objects. We'll
   do that in the constructor:

<p>The first two lines setup the panel and the button. For the panel we used the Shape() function which defines
   an objects size and position. Our box is almost as big as the entire screen (assuming we're running in 640x480),
   there are just 10 pixels on each side left. For the button we use the Setup() function. This is just like
   Shape() only that it takes a few more parameters. The first argument after the position and size is the keyboard
   shortuct for the button. We set KEY_Q which means we'll be able to press the button not only with the mouse but
   also with the Ctrl+Q keyboard combination. The next value is the combination of flags we want the button to
   have. The flags are the same as in Allegro GUI. D_EXIT means that clicking the button will close the dialog.
   The last parameter is the text that will apear on the button. Every character in this text that is preceded
   with an '&' is underlined so by putting an '&' in front of the x we make sure the x will be underlined.

<p>After we have setup the objects we must add them to the dialog. The order in which they are added is important!
   When the dialog is drawn the objects are drawn in that order so if we were to put the desktop at the end it
   would cover everything else. The rule is: first add the desktop, then the panels and then other objects.

<p>Compile the program and run it. If everything went OK you have made your first dialog!

<p><hr>

<p>
<b><a name="step3">Step 3 - Adding more objects</a></b><br>
   In step 3 we will add a few more objects to our dialog. We will add a top bar menu and an event handler function.
   We will also learn how to change the colors and fonts of the objects.
<p>Objects in MASkinG communicate with their dialog through events and messages. The dialog sends messages to the
   objects and objects in return may create events. For example when a mouse button is pressed while on top of
   a Button the dialog manager will send the button a MSG_CLICK message by calling its MsgClick() function. The
   button will then process this message and if it finds out that the mouse button was released while still on
   top of it, it will be activated and will create a MSG_ACTIVATE event by calling the dialogs HandleEvent()
   function. We can overload this function to catch such events. In our example we will have a slider that will
   create MSG_SCROLL events and a label that will display the position of the slider. We will handle
   MSG_SCROLL events in our HandleEvent() function.

<p>Almost every application and a lot of games have some sort of a mouse operated menu. Either it is a top bar
   pull down menu or a popup menu or something similar. The menus in MASkinG too create events so responding
   to a menu click is no different than responding to a button click. We will add a menu to our application
   and we will handle the events it creates in the HandleEvent() funcition.

<p>Finally we will add some text that will have different colour than that defined by the skin. Because the colours
   and the fonts are defined by the skin we will have to overload the MsgInitSkin() function. So add this into the
   protected section of the MainDlg class:
<pre>
   Slider slider;
   EditBox textSlider;
   Label textInfo;
   Menu menuFile, menuEdit, menuHelp, menuMain;
   enum { FILE_NEW = MSG_SUSER, FILE_OPEN, FILE_SAVE, FILE_QUIT, EDIT_COPY, EDIT_PASTE, EDIT_CUT, HELP_CONTENTS, HELP_ABOUT };
   void MakeMenu();
</pre>

<p>The first three lines should be clear - they are declarations of a slider, an edit box (in this example it won't
   be editable because we will disable it) and a label object. The menu is a little more complicated. The menu
   object is made out of several menus: menuMain is the top bar menu and the rest are submenus. The enumeration
   variable are actually IDs of the events the menu will create. The first one equals MSG_SUSER because all IDs
   before that have already been taken by other objects. Finally there is a helper function that will construct
   our program's menu tree.

<p>Now add the following to the public section:
<pre>
   void HandleEvent(Widget &obj, int msg, int arg1=0, int arg2=0);
   void MsgInitSkin();
</pre>
<p>These two functions are already declared in the base class for the dialog. Here we are just overloading them.
   HandleEvent() takes three arguments: a reference to the object that created the event, the ID of the event itself
   and two optional event arguments. MsgInitSkin() is a message handler that is called whenever the skin of
   the dialog changes (i.e. at the beginning of the program).

<p>In the constructor add these lines and move the panel down a little to make room for the menu:
<pre>
   slider.Setup(30, 40, 20, 200, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0);
   textSlider.Setup(25, 245, 30, 20, 0, D_DISABLED, "0", 2);
   textInfo.ClearFlag(D_AUTOSIZE);
   textInfo.Setup(320, 450, 300, 20, 0, 0, "This is a tutorial application v1.0", 1);
   MakeMenu();

   Add(slider);
   Add(textSlider);
   Add(textInfo);
   Add(menuMain);
</pre>

<p>The setup functions are used similarly as in step 2 only that different objects have slightly different setup
   functions. Actually the first 6 arguments are almost always the same but others are specific for each type of
   object. The slider takes 4 extra arguments: the minimum position, the maximum position, the starting position
   and orientation. We made our slider take values between 0 and 9, initially it is in position 0 and it is a vertical
   slider. The editbox object takes the initial text and the number of characters it can take in. The label
   object just takes the text and text alignment. In our case we made the text right justified. Note that by
   default labels are automatically resized to the size of the text so if we want text alignment to have any
   effect we must first disable the D_AUTOSIZE flag.

<p>Now we'll implement the MakeMenu() function which will construct our menu:
<pre>
   void MainDlg::MakeMenu() {
      menuFile.Add("&New\tCtrl-N", FILE_NEW);
      menuFile.Add("&Open\tCtrl-O", FILE_OPEN);
      menuFile.Add("&Save\tCtrl-S", FILE_SAVE);
      menuFile.Add();
      menuFile.Add("&Quit\tCtrl-Q", FILE_QUIT);

      menuEdit.Add("&Copy\tCtrl-C", EDIT_COPY);
      menuEdit.Add("&Paste\tCtrl-V", EDIT_PASTE);
      menuEdit.Add("Cu&t\tCtrl-X", EDIT_CUT);

      menuHelp.Add("&Contents\tF1", HELP_CONTENTS);
      menuHelp.Add("&About\tCtrl-A", HELP_ABOUT);

      menuMain.Add("&File", menuFile);
      menuMain.Add("&Edit", menuEdit);
      menuMain.Add("&Help", menuHelp);
   }
</pre>
<p>The Menu::Add() function takes a text string and either an event ID or a reference to another Menu. This way
   we can make a menu tree as complex as we want. The text that we pass to the Add() function is made of two parts
   separated by a '\t' character. Everything left of the '\t' is printed on the left side of the menu and everything
   on the right side becomes right justified. By passing not passing anything or NULL we can create a menu separator.

<p>Now we'll implement the event handler function. This should most often be done like this:
<pre>
   void MainDlg::HandleEvent(Widget &obj, int msg, int arg1, int arg2) {
      Dialog::HandleEvent(obj, msg, arg1, arg2);

      switch (msg) {
         case MSG_SCROLL:
            if (obj == slider) {
               textSlider.SetNumber(arg1);
            }
            break;

         case FILE_NEW:                    break;
         case FILE_OPEN:                   break;
         ...
         case FILE_QUIT:     Close();      break;
      };
   }
</pre>
<p>First we must pass the message we recieved up the class hierarchy structure, then we can actually process the
   message. In order to do this we first look at what kind of a message we received and then which widget sent it.
   When we know all this we can take appropriate action. In the case of the MSG_SCROLL event that was sent
   by the slider we set the matcing text to contain the new slider position which is passed in the 'arg1' parameter.
   In the case of the menu we handle only the FILE_EXIT event for now and ignore all the ohers.

<p>Finally we will set the info-texts color. This must be done in the MsgInitSkin() function so we can override
   the text settings defined by the skin:
<pre>
   void MainDlg::MsgInitSkin() {
      Dialog::MsgInitSkin();
      textInfo.SetFontColor(Color(128,128,196), Color::white, Skin::NORMAL);
   }
</pre>
<p>We first have to call the base class' MsgInitSkin() method, then we can set whatever fonts, bitmaps, samples, colours
   or any other skin related object information we want. In this case we made the info text have a blue color with
   a bright shadow.

<p>That's it for step 3. You should now have quite good understanding of how MASkinG works and be ready to make
   a GUI of your own.

<p><hr>

<b><a name="step4">Step 4 - Making widgets of your own</a></b><br>
   In step 4 we will make a widget with our own custom behaviour and looks. It will be a simple
   analogue clock which will show current time in hours, minutes and seconds. It will override the Draw()
   method to draw a simple clock, it will install a user defined timer to measure time and it will
   capture input from the mouse and keyboard to manipulate it a bit. This will also demonstrate
   how to use some more advanced features, for example the clock will be round (as opposed to being rectangular),
   it will have some transparent parts and it will be movable. For this reason the code may look
   a bit complicated and obscure, but don't worry, just skip the parts about the advanced stuff
   if you're not interested in them. The basic layout of a derived widget is always roughly the
   same and one of the purposes of this tutorial is to show just that.

<p>So the first step is to make two new files which will be home to our little clock widget. You're
   technically not required to do this, you could put the code just about anywhere you want, but it is
   advisable to organize it in an easily managable way. So we will make a file named
   <a href="../tutorial/anaclock.h">anaclock.h</a> and another one called
   <a href="../tutorial/anaclock.cpp">anaclock.cpp</a>. The first one will contain our widget's
   declaration and the second one will be the implementation. Open the two files to see how I
   implemented the clock widget, the implementation is quite heavily commented. Now let's go
   over the header file together here.

<p>The first part should be familiar - there are some include guards to make sure you don't get
   multiple declarations in large projects (you should always use those no matter how small the
   program you're writing is), followed by the line that includes the MASkinG header. Then comes
   our clock's class itself. The clock is a simple widget derived straight from the base widget
   class, it overloads several functions and has one or two extra variables and functions. Lets
   go over them one by one.

<p>Our clock will show hours, minutes and seconds, which means it will have to be updated once
   per second. For this purpose it will install a timer interrupt that will tick once every
   1000 ms. In order to use this feature of MASkinG, the clock will have to remember the ID of
   its timer and the timerID variable is used just for that.

<p>Then come the overloaded mesasge handlers. A widget might have less or it might have more, the
   clock implements quite a good number of them actually. The first one is MsgStart(). This is
   called once when the dialog the clock belongs to starts executing. The clock installs a timer
   that ticks once every 1000ms in that function. In MsgEnd(), which is called just before the
   parent dialog stops executing, the clock simply stops the timer, nothing complicated about that.

<p>MsgTimer() is called whenever a timer ticks. The ID of the timer that ticked is passed into the
   function with the ID parameter. In this handler the clock checks whether the timer that ticked
   is the one it is interested in and if it is, it makes itself redraw.

<p>The comes Draw(), the main drawing function. In this function the clock receives a canvas
   bitmap onto which it can draw itself. It just draws a simple analogue clock with twelve
   tick marks and three pointers for hours, minutes and seconds, showing the current time.

<p>After that are two handlers dealing with receiving the mouse and input focus. MsgWantfocus()
   simply returns true to indicate the clock wants input focus (remember, we will use the mouse
   and keyboard to manipulate it) and MsgWantmouse() does the same for receiving the mouse.
   However because the clock is not rectangular, the MsgWantmouse() handler has to check where
   exactly the mouse cursor is. If it's in one of the corners of the clock, or if it's not inside the
   clock's bounding rectangle at all, the clock doesn't want the mouse. Only if the mouse is
   inside the round area of the clock, will the clock receive it.

<p>Then come some handlers for dealing with handling input. The clock can be moved with the mouse or
   the keyboard. To move it with the mouse, MsgMousemove() is used. This function receives
   a parameter that holds the distance the mouse cursor traveled since the last update. The clock
   will be moved whenever the left mouse button is pressed down and the mouse moves. To remember
   when the mouse button is down the MsgLPress() and MsgLRelease() handlers are used, they simply
   set and clear the D_PRESSED flag of the clock widget. Actually the clock could directly access
   the mouse state to determine that, but the proper way is through the D_PRESSED flag which
   takes care of some unexpected situations, like for example if the mouse button is pressed
   when the cursor is not on top of the clock and is then moved over the clock. When MsgMousemove()
   detects the clock is being pressed down (D_PRESSED flag is set) and the cursor has moved,
   it simply calls the Move() function which actually moves the widget to a new location.

<p>MsgChar() is a handler for handling buffered keyboard input. The clock's MsgChar() simply
   checks which of the cursor keys are being pressed down and moves the clock accordingly. Notice
   that the movement is a bit jerky. That's because the keyboard input MsgChar() handles is
   buffered. If you wanted continuous keyboard input, you could overload the MsgTick() handler
   (which is called once per tick to provide a function in which one can implement a frame of logic)
   and access the global key array to handle keyboard input, just like you would do
   in any normal Allegro application.

<p>Finally there's the MsgLostfocus() handler, which is called whenever the widget loses input
   focus. The clock simply requests the parent dialog to redraw everything that is behind the
   clock in that handler. It has to do that because it is partly transparent and not all parts
   are the same when it has focus and when it doesn't, so it has to explicitely request this
   redraw in order to make sure the old state doesn't show through when it loses focus.

<p>That's it for this tutorial, all that needs to be done now is use the clock widget in our
   main dialog. Just put an instance of the AnaClock class in the dialog as you would do with
   any other widget.
