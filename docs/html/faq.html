<h1><a name="FAQ">The MASkinG FAQ</a></h1>

<p>A short and most definatelly not a comprehensive list of questions that seem
   to be asked more often than others and of course their respective answers:

<br><br>
<h4>Q: The library won't compile because a file called alfont.h is missing!</h4>
<p>A: In order to compile and use MASkinG you need to properly install two other
   libraries first. The first is Allegro, which I trust you already have, and the
   other is Allegro Font by Javier Gonzalez. If you don't have it you can get it
   <a href="http://nekros.freeshell.org/delirium/alfont.php">here</a>. First install
   Allegro Font and then try compiling MASkinG again.

<h4>Q: How do I install Allegro Font? It compiled fine but what do I do now?</h4>
<p>A: You have to install it in your compiler's directory. Most libraries are compiled
   and installed by typing 'make' and 'make install' but Allegro Font doesn't come
   with a 'make install' command so you must install it manually. Just copy the
   headers to your compiler's include directory and the library (either the .a or
   the .lib files) to your compiler's lib directory.

<h4>Q: When trying to compile the library a get a ton of errors!</h4>
<p>A: Make sure you have installed and configured your compiler and all the necessary
   libraries, including AllegroFont and AllegroGL if you choose to use it.
   If you're using the MinGW compiler or the Dev-C++ IDE you must set the environment
   variable named MINGDIR to point to the location of your compiler installation and
   add the compilers bin directory to the path.
   You do this by typing "set MINGDIR=c:\mingw" or "set MINGDIR=c:\dev-cpp" and
   "set PATH=c:\mingw\bin;%PATH%" or "set PATH=c:\dev-cpp\bin;%PATH%". Replace
   "c:\" with the actual path to where you installed MinGW or Dev-C++ if you
   didn't install it in C:\.

<h4>Q: MASkinG compiled fine but when I type 'make install' I get erors. What's wrong?</h4>
<p>A: If 'make install' fails on your system (it should work on every system with
   a working instalation of the GCC compiler and file utils) you will have to
   install manually. Just copy all the header files (the entire directory) to
   your compiler's include directory and the library (either the .a or
   the .lib files) to your compiler's lib directory.

<h4>Q: I'm using the MSVC compiler and when I build my project it compiles fine
   but I get linker errors about symbols already being defined.</h4>
<p>A: You need to setup your project to use the multithreaded DLL runtime library
   (by default MSVC will use the single threaded version). To do this open
   the project settings dialog, click the "C/C++" tab (the third tab), in the
   category drop down list select "Code Generation" and in the user run-time
   library drop down list select either "Multithreaded DLL" or "Debug Multithreaded
   DLL".

<h4>Q: Can I use MASkinG to make a game or is it only good to make utility programs?</h4>
<p>A: MASkinG was originally meant for making "normal" programs but it can just as
   easily be used to make games. In fact recently most of my efforts have been
   targeted at making it a game GUI library rather than a general purpose GUI.
   MASkinG is now very well suited for making GUI intensive games such as strategies,
   role playing games, adventure games, etc.

<h4>Q: Can I use MASkinG to just popup a few windows here and there and use my own
   engine to do everything else?</h4>
<p>A: Unfortunately no. MASkinG is really not just a library of functions that can
   be called, it is an entire engine with its own main loop. You can of course use
   it for your game's menus and options dialogs and then use your own game engine to
   do the actual game but you can't have for example your engine and some MASkinG
   dialogs on the screen running simultaneously. If you want to use MASkinG in-game
   you will need to design your entire game around it.

<h4>Q: How can I use MASkinG without having to call InstallMASkinG() which wants to
   install and initialize everything by itself?</h4>
<p>A: If you don't want to call InstallMASkinG() for some reason, you have to do
   everything that function does manually. Look for "masking.cpp" in the source
   directory of MASkinG to see exactly what it does.
