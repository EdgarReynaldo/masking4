Initializes MASkinG. It does so by initializing Allegro, installing all
the required modules (keyboard, mouse, timer and sound), loading a skin
and setting the graphics mode. It reads all the settings from an Allegro
config file the path to which you have to provide. This path should be
relative to the location of the executable. This function will convert
it to an absolute path automatically. You should call this
function once somewhere near the beginning of your program. If you don't
want to do that you must manually install Allegro and AllegroFont, set
the color depth, set the gfx mode and then load a skin. If the gfx mode
can't be set with the specified color depth this function will attempt
to set a mode with an alternative color depth. If 16bpp doesn't work,
it will try 15bpp and vice versa and if 32 fails it will try 24 and
vice versa. The only parameter is the path to the Allegro config file
from which this function should read the preferences. If you pass NULL
or don't pass anything (the default is NULL) no config file will be read
and the currently valid settings will be used. This allows you to setup
your program without using the config files before actually installing
MASkinG. If the file you specify can't be found a new one will be created
and the currently valid settings will be used. The function returns an
Error you should check after calling InstallMASkinG().</BLOCKQUOTE>
