<BLOCKQUOTE>
A wrapper for the Allegro BITMAP structure.
It has all the blitting, sprite drawing and primitive drawing functions,
copy constructors, overloaded assignment operators and a few special GUI
drawing functions (like drawing a pseudo 3D rectangle for example). At the
time I wrote this class I thought it was a good idea to have wrappers for
all the Allegro structures but I have since changed my mind. This class
however is almost complete (some functions are missing though) and as far
as I know it works and since I used it throughout the rest of the library
I decided to keep it in anyway. I suggest you keep using the drawing and
bitmap manipulation functions Allegro provides instead of learning the
interface of this class though, but there's no harm using this class so
if you want take a look at the actual header:
