A wrapper for the Allegro SAMPLE structure.
At the time I wrote this class I thought it was a good idea to have wrappers
for all the Allegro structures but I have since changed my mind. This class
however is almost complete and as far as I know it works and since I used it
throughout the rest of the library I decided to keep it in anyway. I suggest
you keep using the sample manipulation functions Allegro provides instead of
learning the interface of this class though, but if you want to use it then
take a look at the actual header:
<A HREF="../../include/MASkinG/sample.h">sample.h</A></BLOCKQUOTE>
