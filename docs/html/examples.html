   In the <a href="../../examples/">examples directory</a> you can find a
   handfull of small examples that demonstrate how to use most features of
   MASkinG. They aren't particularly well documented but are simple enough
   so you shouldn't have any major problems understanding them or the basic
   concepts behind using MASkinG in general.

<p>The examples can all be configured by editing the <a href="../../examples/allegro.cfg">
   allegro.cfg</a> file that is located in the same directory as the example
   source code and executables.

<b><a name="example1">example1 - Hello, world!</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex01.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This is your standard "Hello, world!" program. All it does is that it
   executes a dialog with a button saying "Hello, world!". When you click
   the button, the dialog and the whole program ends. As you can see
   installing and using MASkinG is quite painless. All we do in the main
   function of the program is install MASkinG with <a href="InstallMASkinG.html">
   InstallMASkinG()</a>, create and execute a dialog and when the dialog has
   finished executing clean up with <a href="ExitMASkinG.html">
   ExitMASkinG()</a> and exit the program. This should be quite standard in
   all MASkinG applications. The majority of the code is in MASkinG dialogs.
   As you can see in this example we derived a new dialog from the the base
   <a href="dialog.html">Dialog</a> class with just two member variables and
   an overloaded default constructor. The two variables are two widgets which
   act as a desktop and a button. In the constructor we setup the widgets
   and add the to the dialog. The widgets don't necessarily have to be members
   of the dialog class and you don't necessarily have to add them to the
   dialog in the constructor but I choose to do so as it is most convenient.

<p>
<b><a name="example2">example2 - a large dialog</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex02.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This seems quite a big step from the first example but it really isn't so.
   If you take a closer look at the code you can see that this example is
   almost identical to the first one except that the dialog contains far
   more widgets. In fact it contains just about every single simple widget
   available in MASkinG (window and menus are left for later though). All the
   widgets are the dialog's member variables and they are set up and added
   to the dialog in its constructor. There are a couple of things I should
   point out though, a few functions from the Dialog class are overloaded in
   this example:
<p>In <a href="widget.html#message">MsgInitSkin()</a> we have
   to setup some of the skin specific stuff. The thing is that when a dialog
   starts it is given a skin and it and all of its widgets are informed of
   this event by calling the MsgInitSkin() function. More or less all of the
   widgets read skin specific configuration about themselves from the skin
   at that time so if we want to override a widget's default appearance and/or
   behaviour we must do it after the skin was set. In this example we want
   some panels to use different bitmaps than the default. A <a href="panel.html">
   Panel</a> will by default use the bitmap normally used for a raised panel
   but in this example we make some panels use other bitmaps instead.
<p>The other even more important thing is the <a href="dialog.html#HandleEvent">
   HandleEvent()</a> function. This is effectively the core of a dialog and
   every non-trivial dialog should overload it. In this example we just check
   for a MSG_ACTIVATE message which a lot of widgets send when they are
   selected or in some other way activated (hence the name of the message).
<p>The third overloaded function is MsgTick() but that's used just to animate
   the two progress bars, nothing special there. Actually you can overload just
   about every message function the dialog class has to define it's behaviour.
   Also note that in almost every overloaded function in the dialog class it
   is vital that you call the base class' function you are overloading. This
   is necessary because C++ unlike some other OOP languages doesn't do it
   automatically for you. In most cases it doesn't matter much but as a general
   rule of thumb you should call the base class' function before your own code.

<p>
<b><a name="example3">example3 - windows and menus</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex03.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This example doesn't really demonstrate how to use every single feature
   of the menu and window systems but it does show how to create a window,
   how to use it in both the modal and modeless variants and how to create
   and use a menu. As a bonus it shows how to derive a whole new widget and
   how to use scrollbars. Let's go through the code:
<p>MyWindow is very simple to the MyDialog class from the previous example
   except that it's quite a bit smaller. Also note that we overloaded the
   <a href="window.html#UpdateSize">UpdateSize()</a> function in which we
   resize and reposition some of the widgets to follow the edges of the
   window. This is necessary if we want the proportions in the window to
   stay the same when it is resized.
<p>ClippedImage is a new widget derived from <a href="image.html">Image</a>.
   All that is changes from Image is that it isn't resized automatically
   (we cleared the D_AUTOSIZE flag) and that it draws a bit differently -
   it draws just the part of the bitmap that can fit into thw widget's
   area and it can start drawing from a given offset. We will change this
   offset latef with the use of scrollbars.
<p>ImagePad is a whole dialog that contains a ClippedImage from above and
   two scrollbars for manipulating with it. Again we overloaded the
   UpdateSize() function where we make sure the scrollbars follow the
   right and bottom borders of the dialog when it is resized and the
   HandleEvent() function in which we catch MSG_SCROLL messages that are
   being sent by the scrollbars and we modify the image according to them.
   Note though that we won't execute or popup this dialog. We will set it
   to be a client area of a window instead.
<p>The MyDialog is the main dialog of this example. It contains a number of
   buttons and other widgets and a menu. As in the previous examples we setup
   the widgets and add them to the dialog in the constructor and we
   handle event like button clicks in the HandleEvent() function. I beleive
   the rest of the code should be quite self explanatory.

<p>
<b><a name="example4">example4 - a stopwatch</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex04.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This example should be a bit easier to understand than te previous one.
   All it really demonstrates is how to use user defined timers in MASkinG.
   You shouldn't worry too much about the first part of the code. NUMCHAR
   and NUMFONT are just a couple of classes that implement my own font
   routines for outputting numbers (that's what we're going to be doing with
   them) and don't have much to do with MASkinG itself. TimeDisplay is a simple
   widget that prints out the time with the previously defined font and
   shouldn't be too hard to understand. Then comes the main dialog. It is
   organized in the familiar way: widgets are member variables and are added
   to the dialog in the constructor. Note however that in this example the
   central part of the dialog isn't a part of the main dialog itself. Instead
   it's a subdialog that is made to apear as if it was a window and can be
   moved. The most important part of the program is in the functions that
   are called from HandleEvent(). They are used to start and stop the timer,
   to reset the stopwatch and to record an intermediate time. Notice how
   we install a timer by accessing the static function <a href="timer.html#Install">
   Timer::Install()</a> and remember the return value. We the use this value
   int the OnStop() function and the MsgTimer() message handler that actually
   runs the stopwatch.

<p>
<b><a name="example5">example5 - a tetris clone</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex05.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   Example 5 is an almost complete clone of the poopular game of Tetris.
   There are no sounds or special graphics effects but everything else
   including a highscore list is there and is completely functional. This
   example is quite complex though and I really don't have the time nor the
   patience to go through and explain all that code. But most of it is simple
   and straightforward so if you're feeling brave your welcome to browse through
   the code and learn from it.

<p>
<b><a name="example6">example6 - a piano application</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex06.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   A simple application that looks like a piano. It can load a sample in
   either wav, voc or its (Impulse Tracker sample) format. When the
   piano view has input focus you can play a "piano" with your keyboard.

<p>
<b><a name="example7">example7 - scrollbox and textarea</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex07.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This example shows how to use the ScrollBox class to make scrollable widgets
   and the TextArea widget that extends ScrollBox and implements a multiline
   text area box with optional scrollers. The example also implements an
   image box for displaying a bitmap and is similar to the one in example 03
   although it uses a completely different approach to adding scrollers to
   a window.

<p>
<b><a name="example8">example8 - scrolling starfield</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex08.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   Demonstrates how MASkinG can be used in a "serious" game. There is a
   starfield widget which contains a space with some stars. The space
   is larger than the screen area so only a small part of it is seen at
   a time and the rest can be scrolled to by moving the mouse pointer to
   the edge of the space area. There is also a minimap widget connected
   to the space area and shows how different widgets can communicate
   in MASkinG.

<p>
<b><a name="example9">example9 - polling a MASkinG dialog</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex09.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This example show how to include MASkinG into an existing project that
   has its own engine. Instead of calling InstallMASkinG() all the required
   modules have to be installed, a skin has to be loaded and a couple of
   other things have to be done. Instead of executing a dialog with
   Dialog::Execute() a dialog can also be polled, you just need to call
   MsgStart() once at the beginning, MsgIdle() in the main loop and
   MsgEnd() when you're done. You also need to redirect the GUI to draw
   onto your own buffer by creating a screen update driver that exposes
   that buffer to your MASkinG dialog.

<p>
<b><a name="example10">example10 - adding and removing widgets dynamically</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex10.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This example shows how you can animate a dialog by dynamically adding
   and removing widgets to and from it. In the example when the dialog
   starts it is empty, but then at regular intervals, driven by a timer,
   buttons are added until the dialog is full. When the dialog is closed,
   it doesn't close immediatelly, but instead starts the animation timer
   again, which in this case makes the dialog remove the buttons one by
   one until they're all gone, at which time the dialog actually closes
   itself. The example also shows how you can make buttons use custom
   bitmaps instead of the default one.

<p>
<b><a name="example11">example11 - making user defined tooltips</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex11.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This example shows how you can derive a user defined tooltip class from
   the default one and draw any kind of tooltip help bubbles you want.
   In the example we make a tooltip class that parses the tooltip text
   for instructions to draw geometric shapes such as circles, squares
   and triangles and if it finds them it draws the appropriate shape,
   otherwise it calls the default implementation of the tooltip. In a
   real application you might want to draw other non-textual content in
   a tooltip help bubble such as bitmaps, icons, etc.

<p>
<b><a name="example12">example12 - how to use tab panels</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex12.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   This extremely simple example shows how you can organize dialogs
   or individual widgets with the TabPanel class.

<p>
<b><a name="example13">example13 - how to use splitters</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex13.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
   Another simple example - show how dialogs and widgets can be
   organized on the screen with the use of the Splitter class.

<p>
<b><a name="example14">example14 - how to use normalized coordinates</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex14.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	This example show how you can place and resize widgets with normalized
	coordinates instead of absolute pixel coordinates. Normalized coordinates
	are in the range between 0 and 100. A widget or dialog that whose size or
	position has been set with normalized coordinates will automatically be
	resized and repositioned every time the parent dialog is resized or
	repositioned. This means that if you make a button 60% the size of its
	parent dialog, it will always be automatically be resized to this size
	no matter what the size of the parent dialog or the screen resolution.

<p>
<b><a name="example15">example15 - how to use GLDialog</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex15.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
<b><a name="example16">example16 - how to use GLViewport</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex16.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	A couple of simple spinning cude demos to show how to make a dialog whose
	client area is an OpenGL context and how to make an OpenGL viewport. Note
	that both of these examples will only work if you build them by passing
	ALLEGRO_GL=1 to the make command. Unlike the other examples these two
    read their settings from gl.cfg.

<p>
<b><a name="example17">example17 - making a menu system for a simple game</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex17.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	This little example shows one possible way you might organize your dialogs
	when making the menu system for a simple game. The approach demonstrated
	here may not be perfect or even the right way to do it, but that's how
	I make the GUI in all my games and it seems to work just fine. The whole
	system is a finite state machine where each state is a dialog that is
	run when the state is evaluated. The dialog Run() function returns the
	ID of the state the FSM should go to next, depending on which button was
	pressed. All the dialogs (main menu, options dialog, help screen, credits,
	etc.) are constructed at the beginning of the program and put into an
	array, and the main GUI handler just runs the FSM in an endless loop,
	breaking only after reaching the exit state.

<p>
<b><a name="example18">example18 - a simple Minesweeper clone</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex18.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	This is just a simple unfinished Minesweeper clone. The source is not very
	thouroughly documented but perhaps you'll find it useful to see how
	certain things are done.

<p>
<b><a name="example19">example19 - a simple animated wiget</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex19.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	This example contains just one very simple animated widget. The widget
	has a few states and for each one of them a prerendered bitmap displayed
	(you could of course load the graphics from disk or draw them on the fly).
	The current state is changed once every few seconds (driven by a timer)
	and when this happens, the previous state's bitmap nicely blends into the
	next one. Just make the bitmaps bigger, draw some nice gfx and text on
	them and you have a great looking intro for your game already.

<p>
<b><a name="example20">example20 - how to use wallpapers in MASkinG</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex20.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	Not much to this example, just to show how the Wallpaper widget is used.
	It contains a simple dialog with a button to load a custom wallpaper
	and a few radio buttons to select the wallpaper style. Note that this
	example can only load the file formats that Allegro supports, that is
	BMP, PCX and TGA. You can easily extend this list with the help of
	various add-on libs for loading such formats as JPD and PNG.

<p>
<b><a name="example21">example21 - multicolumn listboxes</a>(<a href="../../examples/ex21.cpp">source</a>)</b><br>
	The ListBoxEx widget is a featurefull listbox control. This example
	shows how most of the basic listbox functionalities are used. The
	code is heavily commented so check it out.
