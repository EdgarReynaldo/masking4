   MASkinG would not be possible without the hard work of a number of people. I would
   especially like to credit:

<pre>
      - Shawn Hargreaves for making Allegro and the original GUI code.
      - All the other individuals who have contributed to Allegro and especially to
        its GUI section (see the Allegro cotributors list).
      - Doug Eleveld for making the original DeGUI, the GUI library MASkinG was
       originally based on.
      - All the people who are working on the FreeType project.
      - Javier Gonzalez for making the AllegroFont library.
      - All the people who have helped and are still helping me with their ideas,
        advices, their own code, bug reports, suggestions, constructive criticism,
        etc. I would especially like to say thanks to Lennart "spellcaster" Steinke
        for making LexGUI, Steve Terry for making NAS GUI, Jason "gillius" Winnenbeck,
