<p>
   To use MASkinG you first have to install it. See the <i>installing</i>
   section of this documentation if you haven't done it already.

<p><b>Include files</b><br>
   To make a skinnable dialog in your application you have to include the
   MASkinG.h header file. At the beginning of your source add the line:
<p><pre>
      #include &lt;MASkinG.h&gt;
<p></pre>
<p><b>The MAS namespace</b><br>
   All the MASkinG code is in a namespace called MAS. This means that if
   you want to access a MASkinG class or function you need to prefix it's
   name with MAS::, for example MAS::Window or MAS::InstallMASkinG(). If
   you don't want to do that you can add this line right after you include
   the MASkinG header:
<p><pre>
      using namepsace MAS;
<p></pre>
   This will make all the MASkinG code accessible in your program directly.

<p><b>Initializing Allegro and MASkinG</b><br>
   To use the GUI part of Allegro one or two things have to be initialized.
   You can do this by calling the InstallMASkinG() function or manually. 
   InstallMASkinG() initializes Allegro, installs the keyboard, mouse and
   timer modules, installs AllegroFont, loads a skin and some preferences
   and sets the graphics mode. If you don't want to call InstallMASkinG(),
   you must manually do everything this function does otherwise your program
   will most likely crash. See <a href="InstallMASkinG.html">InstallMASkinG()</a>
   for details.

<p><b>Your first dialog</b><br>
   After you've installed Allegro and MASkinG you have to make a dialog and
   execute it. There are many ways in which you can do this, for instance you
   can create it in your main() function but the recommended way is to create
   a new class that inherits from the base dialog class provided by MASkinG
   and build the new dialog inside this class. So make the new class like this:
<p><pre>
      class MyDialog : public Dialog {
         private:
            // here you put your dialog controls like boxes, buttons, etc.:
            ClearScreen desktop;
            Button myFirstButton;
            
         public:
            MyDialog();
            ~MyDialog();
      };
<p></pre>
   The implementation should look like this:
<p><pre>
      // All the initialization can be done in the constructor
      MyDialog::MyDialog() : Dialog() {
         // Set the control's size, position, flags, etc.
         myFirstButton.SetText("Hello, world!");
         myFirstButton.Shape(100, 100, 200, 24);
         myFirstButton.MakeExit();
         
         // Add the controls to the dialog
         Add(desktop);
         Add(myFirstButton);
      }
<p></pre>

<p><b>Putting it on the screen</b><br>
   In your main function you can create an instance of your new dialog and
   execute it like this:
<p><pre>
      MyDialog dlg;
      dlg.Execute();
<p></pre>
   Note though that if you have large dialogs you may run out of stack if you do this
   so it's better practice to allocate memory for your dialogs on the heap:
<p><pre>
      MyDialog *dlg = new MyDialog;
      dlg->Execute();
      delete dlg;
<p></pre>
<p>When you're done with MASkinG you have to uninstall it by calling the ExitMASkinG() function.
   This will free any memory used by the skin and make sure your program can exit normally.
   If you don't call this function your program may crash or hang depending on your compiler
   and OS. So add this line somewhere at the end of your program:
<p><pre>
      ExitMASkinG();
</pre>
<p>That's it! If you compile this you should get you average "Hello, world!"
   program (see example 1 in the examples directory if you can't get it right
   yourself).
<p><b>Linking</b><br>
   To compile MASkinG programs you have to link with the MASkinG library AND the AllegroFont
   library which is used for loading fonts.
   The way this is done is different from compiler to compiler. In GCC (DJGPP and MinGW)
   you have to link with these:
<p><pre>
      -lmasking -lalfont -lalleg
<p></pre>
   In Linux or some other variant of Unix this should be
<p><pre>
      -lmasking -lalfont `allegro-config --libs`
<p></pre>
<p>Note: The order of the libraries that you link against is important!

<p> To make programs with OpenGL support you need to link with the MASkinG library that was
	built with AllegroGL support (built with "make ALLEGRO_GL=1", AllegroGL and all the
	libraries it requires. For example like this:
<p><pre>
      -lmaskinggl -lalfont -lagl -lglu32 -lopengl32 -lalleg -luser32 -lgdi32
<p></pre>
	Also you have to define the preprocessor simbol called MASKING_GL. You can do this
	in code before including the MASkinG header or you can define it at compile time
	by passing -DMASKING_GL to the compiler (/D MASKING_GL for MSVC).
